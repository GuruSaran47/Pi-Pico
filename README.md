# Pi-Pico
Contains the header files I made for my pi pico projects in c\c++

This header file works for SG90 servo motor, as there are no readymade libraries on internet for this tiny blue servo.
I made it calibrated for precise control for each degree. 

If you found it useful, please feel free to use it and contribute more to make it better, just incase if I made any mistakes.
